   * Before using a to-do list: I was often indecisive and felt overwhelmed by
   * my ambitions. This would cause me to sit around anxiously, or worse scroll
   * to distract myself.
   *
   * Using a to-do list, I broke down the things I want to do into smaller, more
   * approachable steps. Whenever I don't know what to do, I just consult the
   * list now. The list doesn't have to only include "productive" things, it can
   * just include things you enjoy too. It is just to avoid mindless scrolling,
   * which brings no value to one's life.

        After a tough day of assigning Claude code all my tasks at work, going
        to the gym, and then cooking dinner, it's 8pm. If I'm lucky, about 4
        hours remain in my day. Hypothetically, one of the worst ways I could
        spend this evening would be at a desk, feeling anxious, clicking around
        on my desktop, and then reading for 10 minutes before sleeping. The
        unfortunate reality is that about half of my evenings were spent this
        way last summer.

        When you have big ideas, but you're tired, it can feel overwhelming.
        This makes starting any of them very difficult. But I also wasn't ready
        to resign myself to scrolling. So I just sat around, wondering what I
        should do.
      </p>
      <p>
        This summer, I found a way to break down those big ideas into smaller,
        more approachable parts. A way to be more forgiving with myself, when I
        am genuinely too tired to focus on those big ideas. A way to avoid
        wasting time. I repurposed my college to-do list into a life to-do list.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Write biweekly blog</li>
        <li>Look into meal plan for next semester</li>
        <li>Watch The Boy and The Heron</li>
        <li>Plan to go to the MET rooftop</li>
        <li>Outline KMP app idea</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You'll notice on this snippet of my to-do list that not all of these
        tasks are "productive", nor are they all ambitious side projects.
        They're simply things I wish to do this summer. If I'm feeling energized
        and excited, I can tackle something more ambitious. Otherwise, I can
        take on something smaller or more relaxing.
      </p>
      <p>
        This helps eliminate the periods of indecision. Of scrolling back and
        forth. Of distracting myself from the things I truly want to do.
        Ironically, framing enjoyable parts of my life as work has made me
        happier.
