        I've found a solution to this problem, that for the last couple weeks,
        has served me wonders. A to-do list. Simply write out all that you want
        to do, in a list. Then when you don't know what to do, consult the list.
        Easy, right?
      </p>
      <p>
        Using a to-do list, even for the "unproductive" tasks of your life,
        helps to reframe what a "productive" day looks like. Before using a
        to-do list, trying to have a productive day felt overwhelming. You're
        telling me I'm supposed to work for 8 hours straight, then get home, go
        to the gym, cook dinner, then still have energy left for writing, or
        working on a side project?
      </p>
      <p>
        Having a to-do list put things into perspective for me. If I didn't feel
        like doing a certain task, I could just do a different one. The other
        task is still on the list. I'll get to it eventually.
      </p>
      <p>
        There's also the satisfaction of being able to cross items off the list.
        Then at the end of the day you can look back at what you accomplished,
        satisfied.
