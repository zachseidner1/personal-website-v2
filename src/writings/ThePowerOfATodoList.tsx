   * just include things you enjoy too. It is just to avoid mindless scrolling,

        After a tough day of assigning Claude code all my tasks at work, going
        to the gym, and then cooking dinner, it's 8pm. If I'm lucky, about 4
        hours remain in my day. Hypothetically, one of the worst ways I could
        spend this evening would be at a desk, feeling anxious, scrolling around
        my home screen on my iPhone, checking the weather, and then reading for
        10 minutes before sleeping. Unfortunately, such an evening is not
        hypothetical at all. Last summer, about half of my evenings were spent
        this way.

        When you have big ideas, but you're tired, it can feel overwhelming.
        This makes starting any of them very difficult. But I also wasn't ready
        to resign myself to scrolling. So I just sat around, wondering what I
        should do.
      </p>
      <p>
        This summer, I found a way to break down those big ideas into smaller,
        more approachable parts. A way to be more forgiving with myself, when I
        am genuinely too tired to focus on those big ideas. And a way to avoid
        wasting time. I brought back my college to-do list.
      </p>

        Using a to-do list, even for the "unproductive" tasks of your life,
        helps to reframe what a satisfying day looks like. Before using a to-do
        list, trying to have a productive day felt overwhelming. You're telling
        me I'm supposed to work for 8 hours straight, then get home, go to the
        gym, cook dinner, then still have energy left for writing, or working on
        a side project?
      </p>
      <p>
        Having a to-do list put things into perspective for me. If I didn't feel
        like doing a certain task, I could just do a different one. The other
        task is still on the list. I'll get to it eventually.
      </p>
      <p>
        There's also the satisfaction of being able to cross items off the list.
        Then at the end of the day you can look back at what you accomplished,
        satisfied.
