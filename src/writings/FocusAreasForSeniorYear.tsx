        I'm starting my senior year at Cornell University. This is certainly
        unoriginal, but college has flown by, far faster than I would have
        liked. It would be great to have another few years of learning about
        interesting subjects with all my closest friends living within a mile.
        But the reality is, many of my friends will go their separate ways,
        living across the country to pursue their career goals.

        It is this very knowledge that brings urgency and excitement to my
        senior year. Knowing that everyday is the last day of its kind makes me
        want to spend each moment to its fullest potential. In hopes of
        retaining this sense of urgency and commitment to having an
        unforgettable senior year, I wanted to write out my main focal points,
        for how I wish to maximize this year. I also hope that, by the end of
        senior year, I can write a follow up post on how these points of focus
        have changed, if at all. Here they are, in the order they come to mind.
      </p>
      <h3>1) Spend time with my friends</h3>
      <p>
        At Cornell, I've had the privilege of meeting some of the most talented,
        interesting, and fun individuals. No one is perfect, but each person
        I've befriended thus far has had at least one greatly admirable quality.
        By trying to incorporate these into my own life, my friends have taught
        me such invaluable lessons. I hope to continue to learn from them. But
        beyond that, I just want to have fun with these people, since this is
        the last time we'll all be together for an extended time period.
      </p>
      <h3>2) Learn from my classes</h3>
      <p>
        Another way college is unique is that it gives you the opportunity to
        study any topic thoroughly under professional instruction. Sure, if I
        wanted to I could read a textbook on analysis in my free time to learn
        it, but realistically that's not going to happen. College provides the
        structure and motivation I need to learn at a satisfying level of depth.
        I especially want to focus <i>less</i> on STEM classes during senior
        year. I hope to obtain a wider variety of skills .
      </p>
      <h3>3) Take on college specific opportunities</h3>
      <p>
        This morning I woke up at 5:30AM to go to a rock climbing club. Clubs
        are one of those unique things that are mostly gone after college, so I
        was thinking senior year could be a good time to give more of them a
        shot. Waking up at 5:30 was uncomfortable. Going to a club for something
        I am a beginner at was uncomfortable. However, pushing through that
        friction was rewarding. I tried something new, I enjoyed it, and I might
        even continue going for the rest of the semester.
      </p>
      <p>
        This year I will try saying yes to more things that I want to do, and
        prevent the initial discomfort from getting in the way of new
        experiences. There's great value in making decisions that lead to a
        bigger life.
