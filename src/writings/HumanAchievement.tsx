        In life, we take a lot of experiences for granted. For example, when
        listening to music that comes on the radio, we don't consider the likely
        hundreds of hours that went into composing and producing it. Humanity is
        pretty incredible, and much of our greatest achievements are in the form
        of art.

        I believe that our greatest artistic achievements culminate in video
        games. Absurd, I know, but hear me out. The greatest games combine
        elements of every other art form. They have great music, great writing,
        and beautiful visuals. They even involve another form of art which I
        have yet to mention, programming. Creating a large game requires the
        creator to architect of modular components to assemble different scenes
        and effects. On top of this, there's a whole other difficulty: game
        design. It's easy to make a game, but what's extremely difficult is
        making a <i>fun</i> game.

        once. It took a team of 8 people working tirelessly throughout college
        just to get something semi-professional looking out in the world. This
        experience of creating a game made me appreciate the process much more.
        I saw the herculean efforts required to make even the simplest of
        features.

        This summer I've been diving into Deltarune chapters 3 and 4. The entire
        story was written by one guy, Toby Fox. He also did all of the music. As
        I play, I am not only enjoying the story, characters, soundtrack, and
        art, but also just in awe of the fact that such a game can even exist.
        That Toby can be so talented in these different artistic disciplines.
        Admittedly, he took a few years to create this game, already had the
        experience of creating Undertale under his belt, and this time he had
        some more assistance with the programming and the pixel art. But it's
        still damn impressive.

        I hope to continue to be creative outside of my job, but honestly, it's
        hard. When my work has me thinking deeply about programming problems,
        it's hard to go back home and then think deeply about creative problems.
        It's especially daunting when it seems like there's so many individuals
        with so much more talent than I could ever have. Even if I quit my job
        to work on music composition full time, I seriously doubt I could be as
        good Toby.

        All of this considered, what can I do other than say "Oh well", and move
        on? With the perhaps delusional hope that if I keep at it, perhaps I can
        produce something I feel satisfied with. Make a small contribution to
        our universe and culture. I can only hope.
