        It was during dinner at Keeton on a Tuesday that I realized my day
        played out the exact same as last week's. During my senior year of
        college, the final year of an era that I consider quite special, I was
        just falling into routine. When you realize a month has passed and it
        feels like you just blinked, it's because all the days blended together
        as one, since they all had similar contents. I mentioned in my{" "}
        <a href="/writings/focus-areas-for-senior-year" target="_blank">
          focus areas for senior year
        </a>{" "}
        that "college has flown by, far faster than I would have liked", and yet
        I didn't mention anything on trying to solve this problem.
      </p>

        During that Keeton dinner, a few friends at the table felt similar
        regarding their lives. We decided to create a small group with a simple
        rule: doing 1 new thing everyday. What counts as "new" is up to
        discretion, and is primarily based on the honor system. Once we do a new
        thing, we text in our group chat to hold each other accountable. Here is
        what I got done in one week:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Played a game of Dominion with friends on a random weeknight.</li>
        <li>Made an omelette for breakfast in the morning.</li>
        <li>
          Cooked a huge serving of pesto pasta with chicken for roommates.
        </li>
        <li>Baked Snickerdoodles for the newbies joining our project team.</li>
        <li>

        </li>
        <li>
          Filmed a 30 minute{" "}

          , then participated in a photo shoot for the album cover.
        </li>
        <li>
          Skipped Existentialism lecture to go to the Cornell MEng Expo and get
          a free lunch.
        </li>
      </ol>

        The idea that time passes us by exponentially fast is a haunting one. My
        cope has always been that, regardless of how fast time <i>feels</i>, we
        can get the same amount done in one year regardless of our age. But what
        use is such a truth if it is not exercised? Doing 1 new thing every day
        has encouraged me to continue <i>doing things</i>. Life seems to pass by
        so much slower as children because everything is new to us, and we are
        constantly doing new things. There is no need to lose this sense of
        discovery as an adult. There are <b>infinite</b> things to do in the
        world, and the only thing holding us back from doing them is the sense
        of discomfort in breaking a routine.
      </p>
      <p>
        Try doing 1 new thing today. If you enjoy it, and it makes your short
        time on this Earth pass by just a little slower, then consider doing
        something new the next day, and then the day after that. Do something
        new until doing something new becomes normal. If you successfully reach
        that point, then I hope you'll be able to look back on all you've done
        and feel satisfied that it's taken a long, long time to get there.
