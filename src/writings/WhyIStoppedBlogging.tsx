        There is no social network I hate more in this world than LinkedIn.
        Every time I make the mistake of opening the app, I am greeted with
        posts that all sound the same.{" "}
      </p>
      <i>
        Their app acquired more than one million users in just two minutes. How?
        Their culture allows them to outwork everyone else. All startup founders
        should learn from this.

        As I reread some of the blog posts I've written, I can feel that gray
        corporate tone creeping into my words. Like LinkedIn posts, I fear some
        of my writing lacks soul. It's been hallowed by societal expectations, a
        thin shell of what I think, filled with what others want me to think. If
        that's the case, what point is there to it anymore? The power I have as
        an individual is to write from my unique perspective, but if I am
        writing for the sake of writing I forgo that. To fill the "Writings"
        section of my personal website with writings impersonal to me is far
        worse than to have no writings at all.
      </p>

        So, I won't be blogging consistently. Only when I feel inspired, and
        genuinely feel like writing, will this section of my personal website be
        updated. During those times I can let my self shine through my writings,
        which was the goal with this initially anyway.{" "}

      <p>
        Biweekly blogs are dead, but I hope future posts feel more lively than
        before.
