        , my perspective on software engineering, and my career as a whole, has
        changed. During my freshman year of college, I had dreams of working in
        big tech alongside the world's brightest engineers, solving difficult
        problems that impact so many. The reality is, software engineering is a
        job, just like any other. It has its exciting moments, and its
        repetitive ones. In this post, I'm going to touch on a few things about
        the SWE career that have defied my expectations.
      </p>
      <h4>1. Software engineering isn't about writing "perfect" code</h4>
      <p>
        I always thought that the best software engineers would write "perfect"
        code. Readable, concise, and correct, with just the right level of
        abstraction. The reality is, the best engineers will deliver the product
        as fast as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        This might make it sound like code quality is irrelevant. This is not at
        all the case. Delivering the product as fast as possible is a long term
        goal. It's the engineer's responsibility to choose when code quality
        matters and when something just needs to be shipped.
      </p>
      <h4>2. It's not very practical to code outside of work</h4>
      <p>
        At work, you are solving technical coding problems for 8 hours straight.
        This is more exhausting than you would imagine. When you come home, it's
        more likely that you'll want to do something other than the personal
        projects you dreamed of having time for in college. Some days I have
        enough energy to code, but something just <i>feels</i> wrong about
        coding outside of my job. Coding for 8 hours straight, then just going
        home to do more coding, is an imbalanced life.
      </p>
      <p>
        This isn't to say you can't code outside of work. It's easier to code on
        weekends when you haven't touched the IDE yet that day. But I'm coding a
        lot less than I thought I would be.
      </p>
      <h4>3. AI is changing how we work</h4>
      <p>
        With the rise of LLMs, the value of software engineers is changing.
        Programming is slowly becoming language agnostic. In high school, I
        enjoyed trying to find the most syntactically concise, and beautiful
        ways to do simple things. Although that was fun, the skill is far less
        valuable. What defines your value as an engineer is the decisions you
        make regarding how your code is structured, and whether that can scale
        to meet future requirements. The focus is no longer on having expansive
        knowledge in a specific domain or language. Rather, it's more so on
        solving problems in ways that are simple and clearly correct.
      </p>
      <h4>4. Not all programming is fun</h4>
      <p>
        When you get into industry, you're valuable because you have experience.
        That means it's impossible to learn new things all the time. There's
        going to be times where you need to implement something you've already
        implemented 10 times, but in a slightly different context. There's also
        going to be times in which you're solving a completely new problem, or
        finding a new and exciting approach to an existing one you thought was
        solved. Although it was difficult for my past self to believe, software
        engineering will inevitably have dull moments. However, this seems to be
        true for any career path.
      </p>
      <h4>All of these sound kind of bad...</h4>
      <p>
        Out of all the ways my expectations could be defied, these 4 do not
        change my opinion on the career I chose. Getting free delicious lunches
        everyday and a kitchen stocked with snacks is still real. Making an
        impact for real customers and building features to make people's lives
        easier is still real. Even with the way AI is changing things, I believe
        there will still be a strong demand for quality engineers. I am happy
        with my choice to be a software engineer.
