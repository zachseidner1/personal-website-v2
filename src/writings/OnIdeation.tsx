        One of the hardest parts of writing is coming up with an idea. From my
        brief series of mediocre attempts at creative writing, I've been able to
        improve at this stage greatly from when I started. Here are a few
        practical tips that help me get past the ideation phase and start
        writing.

      <h3>Write down your ideas</h3>
      <p>
        Write down your ideas. All of them. I don't care how bad it is, write it
        down. Whether it's on a cluttered notes page on your phone, or an
        aesthetic writer's notebook, get it down somewhere. Note that{" "}
        <b>it doesn't matter how bad the idea is</b>. After doing this for some
        time, you'll amass an idea bank. Most of them you'll never use. But
        you'll eventually be able to combine a few of the good ones into an idea
        you can work with.

        I like to have separate sections for ideas for themes, conflicts, and
        characters, but you should structure yours however you want to. Let
        these ideas come to you throughout the day, based on what you observe
        and what's going on in your life. Then when you sit down to write,
        you'll actually write, instead of staring at a blank Google Document for
        an hour.

      <h3>Don't be afraid to draw from real life</h3>
      <p>
        Many of the best writers use their life experiences in their work. Jane
        Austen's <i>Persuasion</i> is nearly an autobiography, as just one
        example. It can feel wrong to use events from your life in your writing.
        However, I believe that is essential to writing, and what makes the
        medium of story telling so beautiful. Your strength as a writer is that
        you are the only one with your life experience. Use it to write pieces
        that only <i>you</i> can write. There's no more powerful way to tell
        someone a life lesson you've learned or an opinion you have than
        crafting a story around it.

      <p>
        Making observations of the world around you is a great way to do this.
        Instead of listening to music while walking, listen to the world.
        Overhear conversations. Take in your environment. Write it down. It
        might just spark an idea that you can use.
      </p>
      <h3>Just start writing!</h3>
      <p>
        It's ok if your idea isn't perfect! Sometimes more ideas come to you as
        you're writing. Sometimes the writing meanders around and then fizzles
        out. That's fine! Writing is trial and error. Even the worst ideas have
        a nonzero chance of being successful if you start writing them. I had to
        use this tip to start writing this blog post :)
