        We are rapidly approaching our deaths. One might argue exponentially so.
        As we get older, we perceive time to pass us by faster and faster. This
        is a distressing fact that is preferable to avoid thinking about. If we
        confront this idea directly, there is only one conclusion that isn't
        entirely depressing. Time is valuable, and we must spend it
        meaningfully, before we run out.

        This begs the question, what does it mean to spend time meaningfully?
        Ironically, I've spent too much time dwelling on this very question.
        This meager blog post will act as my final attempt to provide myself a
        more clear idea of how I wish to spend my short life.

        One base case that is generally agreed upon to be a waste of time, even
        by those who partake in it, is the consumption of short form content.
        From this experience, you likely feel entertained and happy while
        watching it. Due to the short form nature, you are likely to forget most
        of the content you've watched. Now you've passed time, but cannot recall
        how you spent it. In this sense, it feels wasted.
