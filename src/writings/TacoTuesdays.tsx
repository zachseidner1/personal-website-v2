        It’s Taco Tuesdays, for the 12th Tuesday, which is 11 more Tuesdays than I should have ever been in this dump. My Mom places the plate on top of my lap. I can almost see my reflection in the brown, muddy pool of ground turkey. My acne got worse, even at age 25 I can’t seem to avoid it. A couple chunks of tomato are poking out of the “taco”. There’s a bowl of nachos on the side, surrounded by a heart shaped formation of salsa.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Well honey, what do you say?”. She stares into my eyes, expectantly.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Thank you Mom”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Of course”. She smiles, and gives me a kiss on the forehead. “I’m gonna run now. Is there anything else you need?”
      </p>
      <p>
        “No Mom”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Ok sweetheart, don’t worry I’ll be back tomorrow.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “I know.”
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m alone, but the occasional beeps of hospital equipment keeps my ears occupied, along with the distinct sound of my Mom’s footsteps leaving the room. The room is lit by an overhead light, in addition to one light across from my hospital bed. It illuminates a sign that reads “PAIN SCALE”. On the left, there’s the number one, and a happy face, without a care in the world. On the right, there’s a sad face, with beads of sweat dripping down the cartoonish circle. Despite its simplistic art style, it conveys the feelings of pain well. Looking at it makes me grateful. Physically, I feel like a one, like a kid who just arrived at an amusement park for the first time and wants to try all the rides. I’m raring to go. But mentally, I’m probably a 9. Not that I have a headache, or I can’t think clearly, or something like that. I just feel like I’m losing it, cooped up in this room with nothing to do. I can’t believe I’ve let myself rot here for 12 weeks.
      </p>
      <p>
        It all started back when my Mom was making her biweekly weekend visit to my apartment in Manhattan. She always insists on making dinner for me, just like she would when I lived at home. Even though she’s not the best cook, I allow her to do so. She seems to take great pleasure in it, and I don’t have the heart to tell her that I’d rather just cook for both of us. We took our seats at the table.
      </p>
      <p>
        “How’s work been sweetheart?”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Fine, as always. Performance evaluations went well last week.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “That’s amazing Daniel! You always do so well. How are your friends?”
      </p>
      <p>
        “They’re doing good. You know, Tom is having his birthday dinner tonight and the whole group’s going out after. But here I am, just sharing a meal with my mom. Kind of funny, right?”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Oh honey, you should’ve said something! Go along with your friends, I can just go home right now.”
      </p>
      <p>
        She pushed in her chair and started putting away her things, despite not having finished eating. “Don’t feel obligated to eat with your lame mom”.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Nooo, Mom, it’s fine, I’m happy to be eating with you.” I put my hand on her shoulder and smiled at her.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Are you sure?”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Yes, of course”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Aww, thank you sweetheart.”
      </p>
      <p>
        This is how our conversations tended to go. She would ask me something about my life, I would tell her the answer, and she would praise me. Occasionally there’s something I’d say that would make her insecure, and I’d need to comfort her.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even though my Mom liked cooking, she never enjoyed cleaning, which meant the responsibility fell on me. I put the water on hot and started scrubbing the dishes. Steam began to rise from the sink and cling to the underside of the cabinets above.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Careful honey! The water looks hot, don’t burn yourself ok?”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Yep, I’m being cautious Mom”.
      </p>
      <p>
        After I finished putting the dishes away, the kitchen smelled of aging meat. I double knotted the trash bag and took it to the chute. When I got back, the skin on my right hand between my middle and index finger was cut, probably from something in the trash. It was bleeding. Mom doesn’t do well with blood. I cupped my right hand and subtly placed it behind my leg. As I entered the apartment, I immediately turned towards the bathroom and locked the door. The lock itself was just misaligned with the hole, I had to prop it up a bit to fit it in. I examined my cut in the mirror. Despite its uncomfortable location, it didn’t seem like much. I washed it off in the sink and went to dry my hands with the towel. It was still bleeding. Uh oh.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Thanks for visiting Mom, it was nice spending time with you, as always.”
      </p>
      <p>
        A drop of blood slowly crawled down my finger. In a controlled motion, I turned my middle knuckles to face the ceiling and cupped my hand, containing the stray drop.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Of course hon–” my Mom’s face turned pale. Another drop escaped to the floor, directly from the source. “Honey, are you bleeding??? Let mama take a look.”
      </p>
      <p>
        She got up and started trying to get close enough to grab my arm. I kept backing away, extending my other arm to create distance between us.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Mom, it’s just a small cut, it’s fine. You know you don’t do well with seeing wounds. How about you head on home, you know, I can handle this.”
      </p>
      <p>
        She got a hold of my arm, and opened up my hand. The wound stared back.
      </p>
      <p>
        “When did this happen? How long has it been bleeding? Is it a deep cut? Does it hurt?”
      </p>
      <p>
        “I just noticed it now, I doubt it’s been bleeding long, doesn’t feel deep. No pain either. I’ll just put a bandaid on it and it’ll be fine. It’s getting late, let me take you to the station Mom.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “You noticed it just now? It’s probably from taking out the trash. Honey, that could be infected. This is serious. I’m staying with you until it stops bleeding. Your mama is here for you sweetheart.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Once she saw the wound, there was no convincing her. I put on a bandage and she stayed for another 10 minutes. I took it off, and it just kept bleeding.
      </p>
      <p>
        “We gotta take you to the hospital Daniel. They’re gonna have to stitch you up.”
      </p>
      <p>
        As much as I hated to admit it, she was right. It seemed that the blood wouldn’t cease, regardless of how long I waited. This is where my memory starts to get hazy. A surgeon stitched up one hand, as my Mom’s leathery skin clasped the other. The surgeon’s face contorted from a relieved, warm smile, to a look of deep disturbance, his cheeks hollow. My Mom’s fingers dug into my hand, as her face scrunched up tight. It smelled like an indoor pool. Time began to skip around. A needle burrowed into my left arm. My veins began to bulge with drops of foreign liquid. My head was floating, detached from my body.
      </p>
      <p>
        I woke up the next morning, my body sunken into the mattress. Mom was on a chair next to my bed, drifting on and off from sleep. There was an old, thick TV mounted above my head, playing the news. I tried to move my arm, but the grip of the needles tugged back.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Mom”
      </p>
      <p>
        She sprung out of her half slumber.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Daniel, you’re awake! What a blessing it is to hear your voice. How are you feeling honey?”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Fine, I really don’t feel much. A little tired I suppose. What happened yesterday? Am I going to, uh, be ok?”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Yes, yes you’ll be ok! During the stitching process the surgeon realized your cut was infected. They had to go consult someone to see if they should continue. They ended up putting stitches in, but we need another doctor to take a look before they can let you go. She should be here in a few days. Don’t worry sweetheart, you’re in good hands now.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “What kind of infection? Is it that dangerous?”
      </p>
      <p>
        “The doctor said something about the dangers of getting stitches in a cut that’s infected. If the specialist decides that the infection is severe, they’ll need to remove the stitches as soon as possible, which is why you need to stay in the hospital. I know it’s strange, but you need to be patient for just a few days.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Soon enough, a few days turned into a few weeks. My Mom provided reason after reason. First, the specialist’s flight got cancelled, but everything was going to be fine, because it got rescheduled and she was going to be here in the next few days. Then the specialist had an emergency, a patient that was in a life or death situation, so of course they should be prioritized, not me, because I’ll be ok, and everything will be just fine, because Mom is here.
      </p>
      <p>
        The excuses and reasons just kept coming, and for some reason, I just accepted all of it, for 12 whole weeks. Thinking back, by week 2 I started to get concerned. But the more questions I asked the more confused I became. They needed a specialist because the consequences of having stitches in an infected cut were severe. The specialist had other priorities that outweighed these “severe” consequences. The contradictions were clear as day. Even when I pointed these out, my thoughts would be rerouted and distracted.

        Week 4 is when I started to get complacent. I got lost in the stories they told on TV. I started rewatching The Office. The characters just felt so real, they helped to quell my loneliness. Sitting in a cubicle working to help a company sell paper now seemed like it would be a real upgrade in life. You know, I never really had close connections like those characters in The Office. I mean sure, they’re not all best friends or anything, but at least there’s this sense of togetherness. The business is small enough so that they all know each other’s names. At my work, I only know my manager, and that’s not exactly someone you can be friends with. The rest of my team is remote. I have my friends outside of that, like Tom, but most of them are in committed relationships now. Our group is a ghost of what it once was, hanging on by a few threads stretched thin, myself one of them. A half a year ago when my girlfriend broke up with me, I started relying more on my Mom again, and letting her back into my life. She was a good listener, and I trusted that she wanted the best for me. The biweekly visits, along with more frequent calls, acted as a bandaid to my loneliness.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here, none of that mattered. There was no voice nagging at the back of my head, making me feel guilty for vegetating in front of the television. All these things that made my recovery period longer were out of my control. There was a comfort to that. I saw my Mom everyday, and I was able to live vicariously through the characters on TV. For the next 8 weeks, I sank into that comfort like quicksand, allowing myself to indulge in a life void of energy usage. The monotony made those 8 weeks feel like 8 days.

        Tuesday of week 12 is when something finally changed. A new nurse visited me to serve breakfast. She said my Mom got sick this week, and wasn’t able to continue taking care of me. Her appearance reminded me of my ex—long, flowing brown hair, soft eyes, and a dimple just to the right of her lip. The nurse’s dimple was to the left, but it still awoke something within me. It made me realize how time was escaping me. How every minute I sat vegetating on this hospital bed was no different than resting in a coffin. My body moved on its own—I sat upright at a 90 degree angle, and began to intently observe my surroundings. I started questioning the nurse about why I was still here, only receiving circular answers in return. Eventually, I told her I’d be satisfied if I could have a notebook and a pencil, to “make sure my symptoms were kept in check”. She complied, and I immediately began to write in the notebook. This way, I wouldn’t forget this feeling I have seeing the new nurse. I wouldn’t let their contradictions keeping me here go unnoticed. I wrote down a promise to my future self: that next Tuesday, I’d be eating some gourmet tortellini at a fancy restaurant in New York City. No more tacos.
